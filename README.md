## Summary
A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds dual wielding mechanics to the game. By default, all swords provide a small amount of damage when wielded in the offhand.  
Enchantments can grant the ability to parry attacks or modify the offhand properties.

## Enchantments
- Parry 
  - Items with parry can be raised like a shield to parry an attack, negating damage and harming the attacker.  
- Riposte
  - Increases the retaliation damage from a parry.
  - Incompatible with Daisho.
- Daisho
  - Increases offhand damage bonus and parry cooldown.
  - Only active when dual-wielding.
  - Incompatible with Riposte.

All of the new enchantments are incompatible with damage enchantments (such as Sharpness and Smite), Fire Aspect, Sweeping Edge, and Looting.

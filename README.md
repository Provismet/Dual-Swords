A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds dual wielding mechanics to the game. This is a mechanical addition to Combat+, granting any Dual Weapon (such as swords) an offhand damage bonus.  
Dual Swords also implements unique mechanics that grant use-actions to Dual Weapons: parrying attacks, or lunging at your opponent.

## Enchantments
All enchantments added are of the *Offhand* category granted by Combat+. These enchantments are universally incompatible with any Damage Enchantment and most vanilla enchantments, such as Looting, Fire Aspect, Sweeping Edge, and Knockback.

| Name | Description | Effect Per Level | Max Level | Incompatibilities |
| :--- | :---------- | :--------------- | :-------: | :---------------: |
| Parry | Grants the weapon a use-action, allowing it to block attacks and counter. | Block duration. | 3 | All *lunge-type* enchantments. |
| Riposte | Increases the damage dealt from a parry's counterattack. | More damage. | 3 | All *lunge-type* enchantments and Daisho. |
| Deflection | Increases the return speed of deflected projetiles. | Higher return speed. | 3 | All *lunge-type* enchantments. |
